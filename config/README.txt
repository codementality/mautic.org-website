As of 02/05/2021 configuration management has been turned off to allow the
Mautic community to manage their website without having to commit configuration
changes to version control.

Config management was re-enabled during the migration from acquia to dropsolid hosting
on 15/06/2023. Can be disabled again after the migrate is finished if need be.
